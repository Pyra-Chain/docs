# What is Pyra Chain?

## Overview

**Pyra Chain** is a petition-focused blockchain with optional privacy, advancing validation mechanisms through ecosystem integration. Built using Solana's open-source code, Pyra Chain ($PYRA) delivers high-performance infrastructure with **41K TPS on a single validator node** while providing a complete ecosystem for developers, validators, and communities.

Our network features a comprehensive vault system for sustainable tokenomics, including treasuries for marketing, development, community rewards, validators, grants, and more. This structure ensures long-term growth and fair distribution without team-controlled supply manipulation.

## Key Features

- **Petition-Focused Architecture**: Built for transparent governance and community-driven decision making. Create petitions with ≥0.5% supply, vote with 1 $PYRA = 1 vote, one vote per address.

- **Private Transfers**: Optional privacy feature that routes transfers through a mixing pool with fixed 100K $PYRA denomination (max 2.5M per transfer), breaking the link between sender and recipient.

- **Instant Utility Stack**:
  - **RPC & Wallet**: Fully operational RPC endpoints and a native wallet for seamless interactions.
  - **Explorer**: Real-time blockchain explorer for transparent transaction tracking.
  - **DEX & Swap**: Built-in decentralized exchange for $PYRA-native swaps and liquidity pools.
  - **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Securely transfer assets between Solana and Pyra Chain with low fees (1 $PYRA) and fast confirmation times (~30 sec).
  - **Launchpad**: Live at [pyrachain.io/launch](https://pyrachain.io/launch) - powered by $PYRA for token launches and community fundraising.

- **Sustainable Vault System**: Multiple vaults (marketing, advisors, development, community rewards, validators, grants, team, insurance, democracy incentives, and stabilization) ensure balanced ecosystem growth with extended vesting periods.
