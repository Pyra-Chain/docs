# Petitions

## Community Governance Through On-Chain Voting

**Petitions** are the core governance mechanism of Pyra Chain, enabling **transparent, decentralized decision-making**. Any $PYRA holder with sufficient stake can create proposals, and the community votes directly on-chain.

- **Create Petition**: Requires **≥0.5% of total $PYRA supply**
- **Voting Power**: **1 $PYRA = 1 vote**
- **Voting Limit**: **One vote per address** (prevents whale manipulation)
- **Transparency**: All votes recorded on-chain and visible in [explorer.pyrachain.io](https://explorer.pyrachain.io)
