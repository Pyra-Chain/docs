# Launchpad

## Overview

The **Pyra Chain Launchpad** at [pyrachain.io/launch](https://pyrachain.io/launch) is your gateway to **community projects and fair launches** on the Pyra Chain network. Powered by **bonding curves**, it enables **decentralized token creation and trading** with built-in **fee burns** to enhance $PYRA deflation.

Process tokens using **$PYRA** on Pyra Chain - bridge first if needed. Discover trending tokens via filters like **"All Tokens"**, **"New"**, or **"Market Cap"**, sorted by **24h volume**, **market cap**, **creation date**, **bonding progress**.

## Bonding Curve Mechanics

- **Progress**: Visual bar shows curve completion - early buys are cheaper.
- **Fair Launch**: No presales; price rises with buys, falls with sells.
- **Burn Integration**: % of swap fee auto-burned on both chains.

| Metric          | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Bonding Progress** | % of curve filled (0-100%); influences price. |
| **24h Volume**  | Total traded value. |
| **Holders**     | Unique owners - gauges community. |
| **Market Cap**  | Fully diluted value. |
