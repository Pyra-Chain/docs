# Buy $PYRA

Acquire **$PYRA** - the native token of Pyra Chain - easily and securely on decentralized platforms. Since $PYRA maintains a **1:1 peg with its Solana counterpart**, you can swap directly using SOL or other tokens via trusted DEXs and aggregators.

## Recommended Decentralized Swaps

### 1. Jupiter Aggregator (Best for Optimal Routes)
**Jupiter** is a leading Solana DEX aggregator that finds the best swap rates across multiple liquidity sources. Swap SOL for $PYRA in seconds with low slippage.

- **Contract**: Buy token `8iHqAtn2z4yi9qrEpm25Qd6NvhoqDmfx19kyz9jCpump` (verified $PYRA)
- **How to Use**:
  1. Connect your Solana wallet
  2. Enter amount of SOL to swap.
  3. Review route, fees (~0.1-0.5% + priority fees), and slippage (set to 0.5-1%).
  4. Confirm and approve transaction.

## Security & Tips

- **Gas Fees**: Solana transactions are cheap (~0.000005 SOL), but use priority fees during congestion.
- **Slippage**: Set 0.5-2% to avoid front-running.
- **Verify**: Always confirm token address: `8iHqAtn2z4yi9qrEpm25Qd6NvhoqDmfx19kyz9jCpump`.
- **No CEX**: $PYRA is fully decentralized - avoid centralized exchanges for now.

**Buy. Bridge. Build.**
