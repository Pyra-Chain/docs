# Rewards Program

## Incentivizing Network Security

The **Pyra Chain Validators Rewards Program** is a **community-driven incentive mechanism** designed to **reward active validators** for securing the network. Our program features a dedicated **10% Validators Vault with 24-month vesting**, plus additional rewards from **ecosystem fees** (from DEX swaps, launchpad trades, and migrations). Rewards are **distributed proportionally** based on each validator's **stake weight**.

This program embodies Pyra Chain's commitment to **decentralization and sustainability**. By channeling **real ecosystem revenue** back to validators, we create a **virtuous cycle**: more staking → stronger security → higher activity → larger rewards.

## How It Works

### Vault Allocation
The **Validators Vault** holds **10% of total $PYRA supply** with **24-month vesting**, providing long-term, predictable rewards for network security.

### Fee Allocation
Additionally, a **fixed percentage** of all protocol fees is **automatically routed** to the validators rewards pool:

| Fee Source | Rate |
|------------|------|
| **Launchpad Fees** | 0.5% of each swap  |
| **DEX Fees** | 0.5% of each swap  |
| **Migration Fees** | 5% of bonding curve  |

### Distribution Mechanism
Rewards are **distributed weekly**:

1. **Stake Calculation**: Total staked $PYRA across all validators.
2. **Weighting**: Each validator's share = (Their Stake / Total Stake).
3. **Payout**: Rewards = Pool Amount × Weight.

This ensures **proportional fairness** - larger stakes earn more, but no single validator dominates.
