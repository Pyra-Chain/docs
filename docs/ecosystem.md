# Ecosystem

## Overview

The Pyra Chain ecosystem is a **complete, production-ready stack** built on Solana's open-source architecture, delivering **instant utility** for developers, validators, and communities. It includes **six core components** - RPC endpoints, native wallet, block explorer, DEX, cross-chain bridge, and launchpad - all operational on mainnet.

As a petition-focused blockchain with optional privacy, Pyra Chain provides **seamless interoperability** with Solana (1:1 $PYRA peg) while achieving **41K TPS** for scalable DeFi and dApps. Our tools are **open-source**, **audited**, and **community-driven**, with transparent metrics and sustainable vault-based tokenomics.

## Core Components

### RPC Endpoints
**High-throughput RPC infrastructure** for developers to interact with the Pyra Chain network programmatically. Optimized for low latency and high reliability.

- **Key Features**:
  - JSON-RPC API compatible with Solana tools (e.g., Solana CLI, Web3.js).
  - Real-time monitoring and failover for 99.99% uptime.

- **RPC HTTP**: [rpc.pyrachain.io](https://rpc.pyrachain.io)
- **RPC WSS**: [ws.pyrachain.io](wss://ws.pyrachain.io)

### Wallet Connect
**Connect your Solana wallet** (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack) to access Pyra Chain. No new seed phrase needed - use your existing wallet.

- **Supported**: Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and more
- **Access**: [pyrachain.io](https://pyrachain.io) → Connect Wallet

### Block Explorer
**Real-time dashboard** for tracking transactions, blocks, and $PYRA burns across the network. Fully indexed for fast searches and analytics.

- **Explore**: [explorer.pyrachain.io](https://explorer.pyrachain.io)

### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
**Native AMM DEX** for $PYRA pairs, liquidity provision, and farming. Powers instant swaps with minimal slippage and low fees.

- **Key Features**:
  - $PYRA-native pools with auto-compounding rewards
  - Integrated with launchpad for migrated tokens

- **Trade Now**: [pyrachain.io/dex](https://pyrachain.io/dex)

### Cross-Chain Bridge
**Secure, low-fee bridge** for seamless asset transfers between Solana and Pyra Chain ($PYRA). Maintains 1:1 peg with audited contracts and ~30-sec finality.

- **Key Features**:
  - 1 $PYRA fee per transfer
  - Deep liquidity reserves

- **Bridge Assets**: [pyrachain.io/bridge](https://pyrachain.io/bridge)

### Launchpad
**Community-powered launchpad** for tokens, DeFi projects, and fundraising. Fueled by $PYRA for fair launches.

- **Key Features**:
  - Bonding curve mechanics (3M $PYRA to migrate to DEX)
  - 1K $PYRA fee to create token (100% burn)
  - Integration with DEX for post-launch liquidity

- **Launch a Token**: [pyrachain.io/launch](https://pyrachain.io/launch)

### Petitions (Governance)
**On-chain voting system** for transparent, community-driven governance. Any holder with sufficient stake can create proposals.

- **Key Features**:
  - Create petitions with ≥0.5% of total $PYRA supply
  - 1 $PYRA = 1 vote
  - One vote per address (prevents whale manipulation)
  - All votes recorded on-chain

- **Participate**: [pyrachain.io/petitions](https://pyrachain.io/petitions)

### Private Transfers
**Optional privacy feature** that breaks the link between sender and recipient through pool mixing with fixed denomination.

- **Key Features**:
  - Toggle privacy option in wallet
  - Fixed denomination: 100K $PYRA (max 2.5M per transfer)
  - No on-chain connection between sender and recipient
  - Native feature - no extra KYC required

- **Access**: Enable in [pyrachain.io/wallet](https://pyrachain.io/wallet) during transfer
