## How Fees Work

| Source | Total Fee | Creator Share |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Launchpad Swaps** | 2% of swap | **0.5% to creator** (+ 1% burn + 0.5% validators) |
| **DEX Swaps** | 1.8% of swap | **0.5% to creator** (+ 0.8% burn + 0.5% validators) |
| **Token Creation** | 1,000 $PYRA | Burned (not claimable) |

> **Creator share is 0.5%** of every swap on your token.
> **Burn mechanism** removes 1% (Launchpad) / 0.8% (DEX) from circulation.
