# Tokenomics

## Overview

$PYRA is the native utility token of the Pyra Chain network, powering transactions, staking, governance, and ecosystem incentives. Built using Solana's open-source code, Pyra Chain delivers high-performance infrastructure with a sustainable vault-based tokenomics model.

**Key Token Metrics**:
- **Exchange Rate**: 1:1 between $PYRA on Solana and $PYRA on Pyra Chain.
- **Bridge Fee**: 1 $PYRA per transfer, with ~30-second confirmations.
- **Utility**: Gas fees, staking rewards, DEX liquidity, launchpad participation, validator incentives, and governance.

## Vault Distribution

Pyra Chain features a comprehensive vault system designed for long-term sustainability. Every transaction is calculated in dollar-worth terms, and vestings will be extended as claiming becomes available if not used.

| Vault | Allocation | Vesting Period |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Marketing Treasury** | 5% | 12 months |
| **Advisors & Partners** | 5% | 24 months |
| **Future Development Treasury** | 5% | 30 months |
| **Community Rewards & Builders** | 5% | 18 months |
| **Validators Vault** | 10% | 24 months |
| **Grant Program & Bug Bounties** | 5.5% | 16 months |
| **Team** | 5% | 30 months |
| **Insurance** | 5% | 18 months |
| **Democracy Incentive Vault** | 5.5% | 12 months |
| **Stabilization Vault** | 5% | 1 month |
| **Emergency Fund** | 3% | Reserved |
| **Circulating Supply** | 41% | Unlocked |

**Circulating Supply**: 41% of total supply is already in circulation, providing initial liquidity and accessibility.

**Stabilization Vault**: Can be used to stabilize any vault above in terms of need.

**Emergency Fund**: Reserved for insurance, bug bounties, and democracy incentives.

**Important**: We do not plan to distribute the majority of the supply. The team does **not** control or manage circulating token supply - we focus exclusively on development, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth.

## Cross-Chain Mechanics

The 1:1 peg is enforced through the native cross-chain bridge, backed by audited smart contracts and real-time liquidity reserves. When bridging from Solana to Pyra Chain:
1. Lock $PYRA on Solana.
2. Mint equivalent $PYRA on Pyra Chain from the bridge liquidity pool.
3. Reverse the process for withdrawals.

## Sustainability & Governance

$PYRA is deflationary by design: Transaction fees are partially burned, reducing supply over time while validator rewards encourage long-term holding. Governance allows $PYRA holders to vote on upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem grants via on-chain proposals through our petition-focused system.

Real-time supply dashboards on the [block explorer](https://explorer.pyrachain.io), and open-source code ensure trust at every layer.
